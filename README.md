# WikiWarningLayer
A warning layer on top of text based retrieval of web information.

For key words and phrases that may indicate high risk emergency situations, we propose a warning layer that gives directives and asks probing questions that could guide a person out of that high risk emergency situation, keyed by the wikipedia page name.

This connection may be a single directive or a chat bot crafted by specialists in the fields. Ex. Specialists from the American Heart Association develop a chat bot that is activated when the word heart attack is searched for via SMS, Web, Facebook, Etc.

Initially, this system connects to wikipedia to retrieve informnation about topics and format them into a text message.
